# Capsul

Have you ever taken a photo and thought: "Wow that saved to my camera roll so quick, I wish it took much longer"? Well this is the app for you. Disclaimer, This app was made satirically. 

Capsul acts as a time capsule of photos from an event. Basically when you take the photo, it is uploaded to a server or to the local system which holds the photos untill a predefined timer is complete upon which a push notification is send and the image is added to the gallery.

This is my first flutter based project of any kind please be nice!
